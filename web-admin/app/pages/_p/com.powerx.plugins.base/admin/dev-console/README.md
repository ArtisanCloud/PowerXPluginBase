# Dev Console Admin Pages

Nuxt pages under this directory power the plugin operator experience at
`/_p/com.powerx.plugins.base/admin/dev-console`. Split the console into tabs:

- configuration management
- audit & activity history
- troubleshooting dashboards and safe operations

Each page should source data through Pinia stores or composables in `~/stores/dev-console` and
`~/composables`, keeping layout concerns and navigation breadcrumbs consistent with the host admin UI.
